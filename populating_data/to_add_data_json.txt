Admire the masterpiece of 220-kilometer long tunnel underground system built during the Vietnam war. Learn more about history of resistance war of Vietnam against the American through document film. Challenge yourself at the shooting range (at your own expense)",
        "event" : "Pick up at meeting point (the service provider's office) or from hotels in District 1 center. Depart for Cu Chi and it takes 1.5 hrs. On your way to Cu Chi from Ho Chi Minh City, you'll pass by the beautiful local countryside, where you can even see ducks and buffaloes cooling off in the river. You would hardly imagine the destruction and damage that once dominated this area, caused by bombs and mines. The Cu Chi Tunnels are a network of underground tunnels in Ho Chi Minh City, used as military base against US forces during The Resistance War against America and are often used as hiding spots or spy operations. The total length of tunnels reach a amazing number of 220 km, mostly constructed by hands, and contains rooms and chambers that met daily life needs: bedroom, kitchen, guerrilla hospital, etc. Simple-but-lethal traps were also set up around the area, making this base a fortress. Don't miss the trial of the legendary rifle AK-47 and enjoy local lunch (by your own expenses)",
